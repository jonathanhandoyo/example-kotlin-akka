# The Obligatory Akka Actor Sample With Kotlin

## Introduction

### What is Akka

Akka is (simply put) a toolkit (arguably a framework, too) to write correct distributed, concurrent, fault tolerant, and scalable application.

### Reactive systems

According to Reactive Manifesto, reactive systems are:
* Responsive
* Resilient
* Elastic
* Message Driven

In this blog series, we will be exploring these points and see what each of them means and how to implement them with Akka.
